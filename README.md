# AccountManagement_v1
 Account management software for Regional Office


Earlier the office authorities were using log books as well as registers to maintain cash records. To get rid of this the TS v1 software was designed.

The main interface consisted of options like account creation, submission, loan sanction, loan installment payment, searching all types of information, viewing the transactions carried out in the software, viewing the statement of an account or loan and an option to back up the database.

The PR Account section consists of new account creation, account info modification and account deletion. At the time of creating the new PR account, details such as the name of the area, district, place, post office, police station and division are also to be entered. Modification of the PR account details are possible by entering the PR account number. But the PR account number cannot be modified so in case of some error in the PR account number the PR account is to be deleted first and then a new PR account has to be created.

The Submission section consists of new submission, modifying submission and deletion of submission. The submission is made against the existing PR accounts in the database. Each submission is made unique by entering a specific voucher number. Then this submission information is saved in the database as a unique record of the PR account. Modification of the submission is possible by entering the unique voucher number. Similarly the submission delete option also works by entering the unique voucher number.

The Loan section consists of new loan account creation, loan account info modification and loan account deletion. At the time of creating the new loan account, details such as the name of the person, loan amount, and interest rate, loan period in months or year, number of payments per year, starting date of loan, scheduled payment and scheduled number of payments are also to be entered. Modification of the loan account details are possible by entering the loan account number. Similar to the PR account the loan account number cannot be modified so in case of some error in the loan account number the loan account is to be deleted first and then a new loan account has to be created.

The Installment section consists of new installment, modifying installment and deletion of installment. The installment is made against the existing loan accounts in the database. Each installment is made unique by entering a specific payment number. Then this installment information is saved in the database as a unique record of the loan account number. Modification of the installment is possible by entering the unique payment number. Similarly the installment delete option also works by entering the unique payment number.

The search section consists of search options based on account number, voucher number, and payment number. Account number of both PR Account as well as Loan Account are accepted. The payment number of loan installment and the voucher number of PR account submission.

The Transactions option provides viewing of all transactions based on PR account created, PR account modified, PR account deleted, PR account submission created, Pathian ram account submission modified, PR account submission deleted, Loan account created, Loan account modified, Loan account deleted, Loan account closed, Loan account installment created, Loan account installment modified, Loan account installment deleted, Loan account installment (s) cleared and Scheduled backup
In the Statement section we can view both PR Account statement as well as Loan Account statement of the given date range.
In the System section there are utilities like calculator and notepad. It provides an option for Logout and Exit. It also consists of the about section where softwareâ€™s development details as well as developer details are available.
